## 1. Goal
Make coverage readable without tables: per domain, list Policy/Standards/Checklist and regulated highlights.

## 2. Matrix (by domain)
- **D01**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: stronger governance, evidence & reviews.
- **D02**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: stronger PAM, access reviews.
- **D03**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: strict segmentation, firewall reviews.
- **D04**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: CI gates, secrets, traceability.
- **D05**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: patch SLAs, EDR coverage.
- **D06**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: SDLC gates, vuln SLAs.
- **D07**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: encryption/keys, backups.
- **D08**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: evidence retention, disclosure.
- **D09**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: HSM/PQC, rotation.
- **D10**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: critical use cases, IR SLAs.
- **D11**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: continuous auth, ZT.
- **D12**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: immutable backups, DR tests.
- **D13**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: audit trails, approvals.
- **D14**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: UI logs, two-person.
- **D15**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: critical risk reviews.
- **D16**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: provenance/signing, retention.
- **D17**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: attestation, tokens ≤ 1h.
- **D18**: POL + STD + CHK — regulated: deployment per segments.

## 3. RACI (template)
- **R**: Domain owner (IT/Cloud/SecOps)
