# Application Vulnerability Management Standard (D06)

**Organization:** ACME  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## 1. Purpose
Define an **operational and auditable** process for detecting, triaging, remediating and verifying application vulnerabilities (code, dependencies, configuration, runtime).

## 2. Baseline requirements
### 2.1 Detection sources (minimum)
- **SCA** (dependencies) on each PR + nightly.
- **SAST** on each PR (or nightly) for application repos.
- **DAST** periodically for internet-facing apps (at least monthly) + authenticated scans when feasible.
- **Bug bounty / disclosure**: reporting channel and handling.

### 2.2 Qualification (triage)
- Risk score = CVSS (or equivalent) **+** exploitability **+** exposure **+** data sensitivity.
- Each finding has: owner, discovery date, due date, status, decision (fix/mitigate/accept).

### 2.3 Remediation SLAs (maximum)
- **P0 — Exploited / RCE / Internet-exposed / auth bypass**: **≤ 72h**
- **P1 — Critical**: **≤ 7 days**
- **P2 — High**: **≤ 14 days**
- **P3 — Medium**: **≤ 30 days**
- **P4 — Low**: **≤ 90 days**

### 2.4 Compensating controls (when fix is not possible)
- WAF/rate limiting, network restrictions, feature flag off, enhanced monitoring.
- Compensating controls must be documented, tested, and time-boxed.

### 2.5 Verification
- Re-test after remediation.
- Evidence = ticket + commit/merge + clean scan (or documented false positive rationale).

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Central vulnerability register (GRC/Jira) + monthly reporting.
- Risk acceptances: formal approval, max duration **90 days**, periodic review.
- Increased coverage: APIs, staging matching prod, systematic authenticated scans.
- Pentesting for critical scope: pre-prod + periodic.

## 4. Recommended settings (examples)
- KPIs: MTTR per severity, backlog, SLA compliance rate.
- Quality: restrict suppressions/false positives without justification.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] SAST/SCA/secret scanning in CI.
- [ ] Periodic DAST for internet-facing apps.
- [ ] SLAs defined, measured, met (or approved exceptions).
- [ ] Re-testing and remediation evidence.
- [ ] Risk acceptances tracked and reviewed.

## 6. Expected evidence
- Vulnerability dashboard + SLAs.
- Sample P0/P1 tickets with timelines.
- Compensating control examples.
