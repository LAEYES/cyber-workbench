# POL — D15 — Risk Engine (GRC / Scoring / AI-assisted)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Mission
Industrialize cyber risk management: risk inventory, scoring, decisions (treat/avoid/transfer/accept), links to controls and evidence, and continuous improvement.

## 2. Baseline requirements
- Defined scoring model (L×I) + thresholds.
- Each risk has owner, due date, status, evidence.
- Risk acceptance is time-boxed (max **90 days**) with re-approval.
- Mandatory linkage: risk ↔ controls ↔ evidence ↔ incidents.

## 3. AI assistance (guardrails)
- AI **does not decide**: it proposes, humans approve.
- Traceability: prompts/inputs/outputs retained (when allowed) + rationale.
- Data protection: no sensitive data in uncontrolled prompts.

## 4. Enhanced (regulated)
- Monthly review for critical risks.
- Acceptance max **60 days**.
- Immutable exports for critical decisions.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] Scoring and thresholds defined.
- [ ] Risk owners + due dates.
- [ ] Acceptances time-boxed and reviewed.
- [ ] Complete evidence linkage.
- [ ] AI guardrails enforced.

## 6. Evidence
- Risk register, decisions, evidence links, exports.
