# POL — D14 — SOC Interface (Console / Dashboards / Views)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Mission
Provide an operational and **audit-safe** SOC interface: monitoring, triage, case management, executive views, and full traceability (operator actions, decisions, evidence).

## 2. Baseline requirements
- Strong authentication via IdP + MFA.
- RBAC with minimum roles (Viewer / Analyst / IR Lead / Admin) and separation of duties.
- Log every user action (ack, assign, close, change severity, add IOC) with timestamps.
- Sessions: timeouts and protections against reuse.

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated)
- Two-person rule for critical actions (close critical incident, delete evidence, mass export).
- UI log retention: **≥ 180 days** + integrity.
- Immutable evidence exports (WORM) for critical incidents.

## 4. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] MFA + RBAC enforced.
- [ ] Complete audit trail.
- [ ] Defined case management workflow.

## 5. Evidence
- RBAC exports, UI logs, sample cases.
