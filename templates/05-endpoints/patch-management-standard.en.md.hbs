# Endpoint Patch Management Standard (D05)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define rules for endpoint patching and updates (OS, browsers, office suites, remote tools).

## 2. Baseline requirements
### 2.1 Governance & responsibilities
- Use an update management tool (WSUS/Intune/Jamf/other) and reporting.
- Defined maintenance windows; user communications.

### 2.2 Timelines (indicative SLAs)
- Actively exploited / internet-exposed: **7 days**.
- Critical: **14 days**.
- High: **30 days**.
- Others: regular cycle.

### 2.3 Coverage
- OS + critical apps (browsers, PDF, VPN, security agents).
- Software inventory to identify outdated versions.

### 2.4 Exceptions
- Documented exceptions with compensating controls (isolation, access restriction, monitoring).

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Stricter SLAs for critical scope (e.g., 72h/7d depending on context).
- Pre-deployment validation (pilot) + full traceability.
- KPIs and regular reviews; escalation on drift.

## 4. Expected evidence
- Patch compliance report.
- Vulnerability management procedure.
