# Endpoint Patch Management Standard (D05)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define **operational and measurable** requirements for endpoint patching and updates (OS, browsers, office suites, remote tools, security agents).

## 2. Definitions
- **Endpoint**: workstation, laptop, managed mobile device, admin workstation, VDI.
- **Patching compliance**: endpoint is up to date per the timelines below.
- **Internet-exposed**: remotely reachable service/agent or tooling that enables remote access.

## 3. Baseline requirements
### 3.1 Governance & tooling (mandatory)
- Use a centralized update management tool (Intune/WSUS/SCCM/Jamf/other).
- Endpoints not checking in for > **14 days** must be identified and handled (remediation, network quarantine, replacement).
- Exceptions are time-boxed and approved (see §6).

### 3.2 Coverage (mandatory)
At minimum cover:
- OS (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Browsers
- PDF/Office
- Security agents (EDR/AV, VPN, MDM)
- Remote access tooling (remote support agents)

### 3.3 Remediation timelines (SLAs)
Maximum time from patch availability (or vendor/CSIRT alert), based on context:
- **P0 — Exploited / Wormable / RCE / Internet-exposed**: **≤ 72h**
- **P1 — Critical**: **≤ 7 days**
- **P2 — High**: **≤ 14 days**
- **P3 — Medium**: **≤ 30 days**
- **P4 — Low**: regular cycle (≤ 90 days)

### 3.4 Process (minimum)
- **Deployment rings**: pilot → production, with documented rollback.
- Monthly KPIs: compliance rate, offline endpoints, exceptions, mean time to remediate.
- Patching must include OS + critical applications, not OS only.

## 4. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Stricter SLAs for critical scope: **P0 ≤ 24h**, **P1 ≤ 72h**.
- Evidence of pre-deployment validation (pilot) and end-to-end traceability.
- Risk-based prioritization using KEV/exploitation signals.
- Automated quarantine for non-compliant endpoints in critical scope.

## 5. Recommended settings (examples)
- Rings: 1% (pilot) / 20% (early) / 79% (broad)
- Target compliance: **≥ 95%** (baseline); **≥ 98%** (regulated)
- Maintenance window: at least weekly (baseline), twice a week for critical scope (regulated)

## 6. Exceptions
- Exceptions require justification, impact, duration, compensating control + Security/CISO approval.
- Recommended max duration: **30 days** (baseline); **14 days** (regulated).

## 7. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] Central patching tool + reporting.
- [ ] SLAs defined and measured; KPIs available.
- [ ] Proven OS + critical app coverage.
- [ ] Pilot/rollback process documented.
- [ ] Exceptions tracked, time-boxed, and compensated.

## 8. Expected evidence
- Patch compliance reports (by OS and critical apps).
- Offline endpoints list and remediation plan.
- Approved exception samples + compensating controls.
