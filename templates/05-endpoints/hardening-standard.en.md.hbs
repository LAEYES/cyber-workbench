# Endpoint Hardening Standard (D05)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define a **prescriptive and auditable** endpoint hardening baseline to reduce attack surface and improve resilience.

## 2. Baseline requirements
### 2.1 Baseline & compliance (mandatory)
- Baseline enforced via GPO/MDM/config management, version-controlled.
- Baseline compliance rate: **≥ 95%** (fleet-wide), measured monthly.

### 2.2 Session & identity controls
- Auto screen lock: **≤ 10 min** inactivity.
- MFA required for remote access and sensitive operations (per IAM policy).

### 2.3 Attack surface reduction (minimum)
- Disable unnecessary services; prohibit unjustified admin services.
- Host firewall **enabled**; inbound deny-by-default except documented exceptions.
- Disable/restrict macros; restrict unsigned scripts.

### 2.4 Privileges
- No local admin for daily use.
- Separate admin accounts; JIT elevation where feasible.

### 2.5 Encryption & boot
- Full-disk encryption: **100%** of laptops and endpoints holding sensitive data.
- Secure Boot enabled where applicable.

### 2.6 Browser
- Automatic updates.
- Extensions allow-list at least for sensitive scope.

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Baseline compliance: **≥ 98%**.
- Application allow-listing for critical scope.
- Advanced logging (e.g., Sysmon/equivalent) + centralization; retention **≥ 180 days**.
- PAWs: restrict unnecessary web browsing; strong separation of admin vs user contexts.
- Strict disablement of unused scripting engines.

## 4. Testing & verification
- Monthly compliance checks (MDM/GPO) + remediation plan.
- Validation on OS upgrades (pilot) + rollback.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] Baseline version-controlled and enforced.
- [ ] Compliance measured and tracked.
- [ ] Host firewall enabled + exceptions tracked.
- [ ] Disk encryption proven.
- [ ] Privilege controls (no daily local admin).

## 6. Expected evidence
- Baseline export (GPO/MDM) + version.
- Compliance report.
- Host firewall policy.
- Encryption report (BitLocker/FileVault/LUKS).
