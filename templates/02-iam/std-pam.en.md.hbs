- Alert on: admin grants, privilege elevation, MFA disabled, anomalous admin access.

## 4. Enhanced (regulated)
- Session recording for critical scope.
- Four-eyes approvals for critical sessions.
- JIT elevation for admin roles.
- Break-glass: offline storage, two-person control, quarterly testing, immediate rotation after use.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] Privileged inventory maintained.
- [ ] Vault in place with compliant rotation.
- [ ] Privileged logs/alerts centralized.
- [ ] (Regulated) session recording + approvals.

## 6. Expected evidence
