## 1. Goal
Enforce MFA for sensitive access with **auditable** requirements (coverage, factors, exceptions).

## 2. Scope

## 3. Baseline requirements

- Block legacy / non-MFA authentication.
- Conditional access (risk, geo, compliant device) where available.

### 3.4 Exceptions
- Time-boxed: max **30 days** (baseline); **14 days** (regulated).

## 4. Enhanced (regulated)
- Phishing-resistant MFA required for admins and critical scope access.
- Strong admin enrollment (identity proofing).
- Monthly reviews of enrolled factors/devices.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] 100% admins under MFA.
- [ ] User coverage ≥ 95%.
- [ ] Legacy auth blocked.
- [ ] Exceptions tracked, approved, time-boxed.

## 6. Expected evidence
- IdP/MFA configuration export.
