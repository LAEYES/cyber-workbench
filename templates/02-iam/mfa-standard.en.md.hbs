# MFA Standard (Multi‑Factor Authentication)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define {{org}} MFA standard: where, when, and how multi‑factor authentication must be enforced.

## 2. Definitions
- **MFA**: at least two of *knowledge* (password), *possession* (token), *inherence* (biometrics).
- **Phishing‑resistant**: key‑based factors (FIDO2/WebAuthn) resilient to phishing/proxy attacks.

## 3. Baseline requirements
### 3.1 MFA mandatory use cases
- Remote access (VPN, external web access, VDI).
- Administrative environments (cloud console, hypervisors, directories).
- Applications processing sensitive data.

### 3.2 Allowed factors
- Recommended: authenticator app (TOTP) or push with number matching.
- Allowed only as last resort: SMS (SIM‑swap risk).
- Biometrics: acceptable when paired with possession (e.g., passkeys on managed devices).

### 3.3 Enrollment & recovery
- Controlled enrollment (identity verification, corporate email/phone, managed device when possible).
- Documented recovery flow with limits on resets.
- Backup codes stored in a vault (password manager) and rotated.

### 3.4 Exceptions and emergency accounts
- Break‑glass accounts: very limited, restricted usage, monitored, secrets rotated.
- Any MFA exception: justified, approved, time‑bound, with compensating controls.

### 3.5 Logging
- Log: enrollments, factor removal, bypass, MFA failures.
- Alert on: repeated attempts, bypass usage, factor changes.

## 4. Enhanced requirements (regulated environments)
- Phishing‑resistant MFA required for privileged accounts and critical environments.
- Step‑up MFA for sensitive actions (privilege elevation, IAM changes, data export).
- Block legacy authentication protocols (basic auth, etc.).
- Device posture controls for critical access.

## 5. Checks (examples)
- % accounts covered by MFA (overall / admins / third parties).
- Leaver offboarding: time to remove access and factors.
