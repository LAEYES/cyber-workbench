# POL — D02 — IAM Policy (Identity & Access Management)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define **measurable and auditable** identity, authentication and authorization requirements to reduce compromise risk and limit blast radius.

## 2. Scope
- Human users, service accounts, privileged accounts.
- Internal/remote access, cloud/SaaS, APIs.

## 3. Baseline requirements
### 3.1 Inventory & source of truth (mandatory)
- Maintain an identity inventory (humans/services).
- Shared accounts are **prohibited** unless approved exception.

### 3.2 Joiner/Mover/Leaver SLAs
- Provisioning via workflow (ticket/IGA).
- Leaver deprovisioning: **≤ 24h**; **≤ 4h** for sensitive accounts.
- Immediate disablement on incident/suspicion.

### 3.3 Authentication
- MFA required for:
  - remote access
  - SSO/IdP
  - cloud consoles
  - privileged accounts
- Password policy: length **≥ 14**, lockout/rate limiting, anti-password-spraying.

### 3.4 Authorization
- RBAC via groups/roles; no direct individual grants except approved exceptions.
- Sensitive access: time-bound (JIT) where feasible.
- Access reviews:
  - critical scope: **monthly**
  - others: **quarterly**

### 3.5 Logging & alerting
- Centralize IAM logs: authentications, MFA, IAM changes, privilege elevations.
- Retention: **≥ 90 days** (baseline).

## 4. Enhanced requirements (regulated)
- Phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn) for administrators.
- IGA: attestations, SoD, evidence.
- PAM mandatory: vault + rotation + session recording (critical scope) + approvals.
- Third-party access: dedicated accounts, JIT/JEA, ZTNA, no shared accounts.
- Log retention: **≥ 180 days** + integrity.

## 5. Exceptions
Exceptions must be documented, compensated, time-bound and approved by Security/CISO.

## 6. KPIs
- MFA coverage (users/admins)
- % privileged accounts under PAM
- Mean deprovisioning time
- % access reviews completed on time

## 7. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] MFA enforced for required scope.
- [ ] JML SLAs met.
- [ ] Access reviews tracked.
- [ ] IAM logs centralized with retention.
- [ ] Exception management evidenced.
