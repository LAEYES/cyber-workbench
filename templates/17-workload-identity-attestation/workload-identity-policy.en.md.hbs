# POL — D17 — Machine & Workload Identity (Workload Identity / Attestation)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Objective
Eliminate static secrets and enforce **verifiable identity** for workloads (containers, VMs, serverless) with attestation, least privilege, and full auditability.

## 2. Baseline requirements
- All service-to-service communications use workload identity (OIDC/SPIFFE or equivalent).
- Prohibit long-lived secrets for production workloads (unrotated API keys, shared passwords).
- Short-lived certs/tokens: lifetime **≤ 24h** (baseline).
- RBAC/ABAC: permissions per service, environment, and scope.

## 3. Enhanced (regulated)
- Attestation required (measurements, image digest, posture) before identity issuance.
- Token/cert lifetime **≤ 1h**.
- Two-person approval for exceptions.

## 4. SLAs / pass-fail
- 100% of prod workloads identified (no anonymous access).
- 0 unmanaged static secrets in production.

## 5. Expected evidence
- Workload identity/IdP config, policies, issuance logs, secrets inventory, rotation reports.
