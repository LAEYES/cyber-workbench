**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define the detection, triage, remediation and verification process for application vulnerabilities (code, dependencies, configuration).

## 2. Baseline requirements
### 2.1 Detection
- Regular SAST/SCA (at least on each PR or daily).
- Periodic DAST scanning for internet-facing applications.

### 2.2 Triage
- Risk-based qualification (CVSS + exploitability + exposure + data).
- Assign an owner and remediation due date.

### 2.3 Timelines (indicative SLAs)
- Exploited/internet-exposed/RCE: **7 days**.
- Critical: **14 days**.
- High: **30 days**.

### 2.4 Verification
- Re-test after remediation.
- Remediation evidence (ticket + commit + clean scan).

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Formal vulnerability register + periodic reporting.
- Risk acceptances tracked, approved and reviewed.
- Authenticated scans and increased coverage (APIs, staging matching prod).

## 4. Expected evidence
- Vulnerability dashboard.
- SLAs and remediation history.
