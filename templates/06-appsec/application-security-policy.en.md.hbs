# Application Security & SDLC Policy (D06)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define **auditable and measurable** application security / SDLC requirements to reduce vulnerabilities, secure the software supply chain, and improve the resilience of applications and APIs.

## 2. Baseline requirements
### 2.1 Governance (mandatory)
- Application owner identified (risk owner).
- Criticality and exposure (internet/internal) documented.

### 2.2 CI/CD gates (mandatory)
- Build + unit tests pass.
- SAST/SCA/secret scanning executed.
- Block on **secrets** and **critical** vulnerabilities unless approved exception.

### 2.3 Threat modeling (targeted)
- Mandatory for internet-facing applications and/or sensitive data.

### 2.4 Security observability
- Application security logs (auth, admin actions, errors) enabled and centralized.
- Retention: **≥ 90 days** (baseline).

### 2.5 Vulnerability SLAs
- Conform to D06 Vulnerability Management standard; track SLA compliance.

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Systematic threat modeling for critical scope and major changes.
- SBOM for critical apps + provenance + artifact signing.
- Pre-prod and periodic pentesting (at least yearly) for critical scope.
- Log retention: **≥ 180 days** + integrity.

## 4. Exceptions
Exceptions must be tracked, approved and time-boxed.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] CI/CD gates in place with evidence.
- [ ] Threat modeling performed for required scope.
- [ ] Security logs centralized with retention.
- [ ] Vulnerability process with SLAs and evidence.

## 6. Expected evidence
- Branch protection + required checks.
- SAST/SCA/secret scan reports.
- Threat model samples.
- Log/alert extracts + retention evidence.
