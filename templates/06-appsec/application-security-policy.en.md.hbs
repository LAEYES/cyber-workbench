# Application Security & SDLC Policy (D06)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define application security and secure SDLC/DevSecOps requirements to reduce vulnerabilities, secure the delivery pipeline, and improve the resilience of applications and APIs.

## 2. Scope
- Internal and internet-facing applications, APIs, microservices, frontends, batch jobs.
- In-house, outsourced and configured software.
- Delivery pipeline: repositories, CI/CD, artifacts, environments.
- Profiles: SME={{profiles.pme}}, Mid={{profiles.eti}}, Regulated={{profiles.regulated}}.

## 3. Principles
- **Security by design**: requirements from design phase.
- **Shift-left & automation**: security testing in CI/CD.
- **Least privilege** for CI/CD and secrets.
- **Traceability**: PR → build → release → deployment.
- **Risk-based vulnerability management** (exploited/exposed/critical).

## 4. Governance & responsibilities
- **Product/App Owner**: prioritization and risk acceptance.
- **Engineering**: implementation, remediation, evidence.
- **Security/AppSec**: standards, reviews, coaching, decisions.
- **Ops/SRE**: runtime configuration, logs, WAF/monitoring, incident response.

## 5. Baseline requirements
### 5.1 Requirements & threat modeling
- Security requirements documented for each critical application.
- Threat modeling at least for internet-facing apps or sensitive data.

### 5.2 Secure coding
- Secure coding rules (OWASP) and PR-based code reviews.
- Error handling without information leakage; input validation.

### 5.3 Security testing
- SAST (code) and SCA (dependencies) in CI.
- DAST or periodic dynamic testing for internet-facing apps.

### 5.4 Secrets & CI/CD
- Store secrets in a vault; no secrets in repositories.
- Dedicated CI/CD identities with least privilege and short-lived tokens.

### 5.5 Vulnerabilities
- Triage and remediation workflow; track fixes.
- Compensating controls allowed (WAF, feature disablement, network restrictions).

## 6. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Systematic threat modeling for critical scope and major changes.
- SBOM for critical apps + supply chain provenance controls.
- Artifact signing and integrity verification.
- Pre-production pentest and periodic testing (e.g., yearly) for critical scope.
- Strict remediation SLAs and formal governance/reporting.
- Enhanced application logging + SIEM correlation.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exception must be documented, justified, time-bound, compensated, and approved by Security/CISO.

## 8. Expected evidence (examples)
- SDLC checklist and CI/CD pipeline evidence.
- SAST/SCA/DAST reports + remediation plans.
- Vulnerability register + SLAs.
- Pentest reports (if applicable).
