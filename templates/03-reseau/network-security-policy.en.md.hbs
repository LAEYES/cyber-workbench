# POL — D03 — Network & Infrastructure Security Policy

**Organisation:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define security requirements for the design, operation and evolution of {{org}} networks and infrastructure (LAN/WAN/Wi‑Fi, datacenter, cloud, interconnections).

## 2. Scope
- Internal networks (campus, sites, DC), cloud networks (VPC/VNet), DMZ, and OT/industrial networks when applicable.
- Assets and services: routers, firewalls, switches, Wi‑Fi, VPN/remote access, DNS/DHCP/IPAM, proxies, partner links.
- Administrative tooling (NMS, configuration backups, bastions).

## 3. Principles
- **Defense in depth:** segmentation + filtering + hardening + monitoring.
- **Network least privilege:** deny by default; allow explicitly.
- **Traceability:** log critical events and changes.
- **Availability:** resilience aligned to business needs.
- **Secure-by-design:** controlled changes and architecture reviews.

## 4. Baseline requirements
### 4.1 Architecture & segmentation
- Networks are segmented at minimum into: users, servers, administration, DMZ, guest/IoT, backups.
- Inter-zone flows are **documented** (src/dst/ports/protocol/justification/owner) and **reviewed**.
- Infrastructure administration is performed from dedicated admin networks (OOB or isolated in-band).

### 4.2 Traffic filtering & access control
- Inter-zone filtering uses centralized firewall/ACL; rules are **specific**, **justified**, and **time-bound** when exceptional.
- Rule lifecycle management: create → review → optimize → remove.
- Internet exposure of admin services (SSH/RDP/WinRM) is forbidden unless through an approved controlled solution.

### 4.3 Remote access (VPN / ZTNA)
- Remote access is allowed only via approved solutions with MFA and (when available) device posture.
- Separate user access from administrator access; log all remote sessions.
- Split tunneling is disabled by default unless documented with compensating controls.

### 4.4 Device hardening & lifecycle
- Maintain an inventory of network devices (model, version, location, owner, criticality).
- Harden devices: disable unused services, remove default accounts, encrypt management channels.
- Vulnerability management: track versions, patch based on severity, prohibit end-of-support devices.
- Backup configurations and test restoration.

### 4.5 Core network services (DNS/DHCP/NTP)
- Secure internal DNS (access controls, logging, protect against unauthorized transfers).
- Use internal NTP references; time sync is mandatory for devices.
- Govern DHCP and IPAM; detect rogue DHCP servers.

### 4.6 Monitoring & detection
- Centralize logs (firewalls, VPN, DNS, key devices) to SIEM/central tooling.
- Alert on: rule changes, new objects, spikes in drops/denies, abnormal authentication, non-compliant tunnels.
- Provide proportionate network forensics (SPAN/TAP, NetFlow/IPFIX, proxy logs).

## 5. Enhanced requirements (regulated)
- Formal **security architecture review** before production (risks, flows, data, encryption, logging).
- **Micro-segmentation** for critical assets (sensitive workloads, admin, backups) using policy-based controls.
- **Bastion-based administration** (JIT/JEA), session recording, strict separation of duties.
- Mandatory **encryption** for sensitive interconnections (site-to-site, cloud-to-DC) with key management.
- Strengthened operations: patch SLAs, recovery tests, periodic rule clean-up, configuration audits.

## 6. Roles & responsibilities
- **Network owner:** architecture, segmentation, operations, inventory.
- **Security:** requirements, reviews, exception governance, periodic assurance.
- **Application teams:** flow requirements, testing, validation.

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions must be justified, time-limited, approved, documented with compensating controls and a review date.

## 8. Metrics
- % of inter-zone flows documented and reviewed
- Firewall rule age / % expired rules removed
- Network device patch compliance rate

## 9. Review
Annual review and after major incidents or significant changes (new site, cloud landing zone, WAN redesign).
