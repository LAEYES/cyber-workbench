# STD — D09 — PQC & Hybrid TLS (crypto agility)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Goal
Define a **quantum-ready** roadmap via crypto agility and hybridization (classical + PQC) when supported, without reducing availability.

## 2. Baseline requirements
- Inventory critical flows (Highly sensitive data / identity / interconnects).
- Migration strategy: prioritize long confidentiality needs.
- Compatibility and performance testing prior to enablement.

## 3. Enhanced (regulated)
- Enable hybrid TLS on supported critical flows (e.g., interconnects, admin access).
- Version-controlled crypto policy; documented rollback.

## 4. Evidence
- Flow inventory, test results, enable/rollback decision.
