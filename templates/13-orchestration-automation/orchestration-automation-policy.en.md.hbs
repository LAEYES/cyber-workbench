# POL — D13 — Orchestration & Automation Engine (SOAR / Workflow / Policy-as-Code)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Mission
Industrialize a coherent cyber platform via a **core orchestrator**: event ingestion, decisioning, playbook execution, evidence/audit trails, and continuous improvement loops.

## 2. Non-negotiable principles
- **Safety-by-design**: no auto-remediation without guardrails.
- **Least privilege** connector scopes.
- **Four-eyes** for destructive/high-impact actions (regulated).
- **Idempotence**: replaying a playbook must not worsen outcomes.
- Full traceability: who/what/when/why.

## 3. Baseline requirements
### 3.1 Workflow & governance
- Playbook catalog + owners + versioning.
- Separate dev/test/prod.
- PR required for playbook/policy changes.

### 3.2 Execution security
- Secrets via vault.
- Prefer short-lived tokens (OIDC).
- Log every executed action.

### 3.3 SLAs & metrics
- % playbooks tested: **≥ 80%**.
- Auto-remediation rate measured and reviewed monthly.
- Track MTTR by incident type.

## 4. Enhanced requirements (regulated)
- Two-person rule for critical actions (disable admin account, wipe device, rotate prod keys).
- Immutable logs (WORM) for critical evidence.
- Quarterly review of high-impact playbooks.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] Versioned and reviewed playbooks/policies.
- [ ] dev/test/prod separation.
- [ ] Guardrails and approvals for critical actions.
- [ ] Full traceability + retention.

## 6. Evidence
- Playbook catalog, PRs, execution logs, test reports.
