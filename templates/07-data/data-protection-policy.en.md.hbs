# POL — D07 — Data Protection Policy

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define **measurable and auditable** data protection requirements (classification, access, encryption, retention, backup, DLP) to reduce leakage, integrity loss and unavailability risks.

## 2. Scope
- Business, HR, customer, personal data, secrets, logs.
- Storage: endpoints, servers, SaaS, cloud object storage, databases.

## 3. Baseline requirements
### 3.1 Classification (mandatory)
- Minimum 4 levels: **Public / Internal / Confidential / Highly sensitive**.
- Data owner mandatory for each critical dataset/application.

### 3.2 Access
- RBAC and least privilege.
- Access reviews: sensitive scope **quarterly** (baseline).

### 3.3 Encryption
- TLS in transit.
- At-rest encryption for **Confidential+**.

### 3.4 Retention & deletion
- Retention rules defined per category + deletion at end of life.

### 3.5 Backup & restore
- RPO/RTO defined for critical systems.
- Restore tests: **at least quarterly** for critical scope.

### 3.6 DLP / egress controls
- Egress controls for **Confidential+** (no public sharing, controlled external links).

## 4. Enhanced requirements (regulated)
- Access reviews: **monthly** for critical scope + formal recertification.
- Customer-managed keys (KMS/HSM/BYOK) for critical scope.
- Immutable backups (WORM) + logical air-gap where feasible.
- Data access log retention: **≥ 180 days** + integrity.

## 5. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] Classification deployed + owners identified.
- [ ] RBAC + access reviews performed.
- [ ] Encryption in transit and at rest (Confidential+).
- [ ] Retention/deletion enforced.
- [ ] Backups tested.

## 6. Expected evidence
- Classification matrix + owners.
- RBAC exports + review reports.
- Encryption evidence (KMS/TLS settings).
- Restore test reports.
