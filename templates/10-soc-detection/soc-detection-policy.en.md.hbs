# POL — D10 — SOC / Detection & Response (SIEM, XDR, IR, CTI)

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Mission
Build a “cyber nervous system”: detection (SIEM/XDR), response (IR/SOAR), intelligence (CTI), and incident handling, with **measurable** requirements (MTTD/MTTR, log coverage, alert quality).

## 2. Baseline requirements
### 2.1 Log coverage (mandatory)
- Centralize at minimum: IdP/IAM, EDR, firewalls/VPN, cloud audit, DNS.
- Retention: **≥ 90 days** (baseline).

### 2.2 Detection & triage
- Prioritized use-case catalog (phishing, admin abuse, malware, lateral movement).
- Triage SLAs:
  - Critical: **≤ 1h**
  - High: **≤ 4h**
  - Medium: **≤ 24h**

### 2.3 Incident response
- Documented IR runbooks (containment, eradication, recovery).
- Exercises: **yearly**.

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated)
- Log retention: **≥ 180 days** + integrity.
- SOAR/automated playbooks (isolate host, block IOCs, disable account).
- CTI feeds integrated + validated.
- Exercises: **semi-annually** for critical scope.

## 4. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] Minimum log sources integrated.
- [ ] Triage SLAs defined and measured.
- [ ] IR runbooks + exercises.
- [ ] Log retention and integrity.

## 5. Evidence
- Log source list + ingestion rate.
- Alert tickets with timelines.
- IR exercise reports.
