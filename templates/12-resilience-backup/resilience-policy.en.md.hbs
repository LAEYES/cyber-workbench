**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.2 (hardened)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Mission
Ensure **cyber resilience**: business continuity (BCP), disaster recovery (DRP), immutable backups, and verified restores with measurable RPO/RTO.

## 2. Baseline requirements
- Define RPO/RTO for critical services.
- Encrypted backups + **quarterly** restore tests for critical scope.
- Separate copy (separate account/tenant) recommended.

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated)
- Immutable backups (WORM) + logical air-gap.
- **Monthly** restore tests for critical scope.
- DRP/BCP exercises at least yearly.

## 4. Audit criteria (pass/fail)
- [ ] RPO/RTO defined.
- [ ] Backups encrypted and tested.
- [ ] Immutability (regulated) evidenced.
- [ ] Restore runbooks.

## 5. Evidence
- Backup reports, restore test reports, runbooks, exercise results.
