# Cloud Security Policy

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define baseline and enhanced security requirements for the use of cloud services (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) and associated DevSecOps practices to protect data, identities, workloads and the software delivery pipeline.

## 2. Scope
- Cloud providers and managed services (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS).
- Accounts/projects/tenants, workloads (VMs, containers, serverless), storage, network, keys/secrets.
- DevSecOps tooling: IaC, CI/CD, registries, scanning, observability.
- Profiles: SME={{profiles.pme}}, Mid={{profiles.eti}}, Regulated={{profiles.regulated}}.

## 3. Principles
- **Shared responsibility**: make provider vs {{org}} responsibilities explicit.
- **Secure-by-default**: hardened configurations and removal of implicit access.
- **Least privilege** and **Zero Trust**: identity + context + segmentation.
- **Traceability**: centralized, time-synchronized logs protected against tampering.
- **Automation**: controls-as-code (policy-as-code), detection and remediation.

## 4. Governance & responsibilities
- **Cloud Owner / Platform Team**: landing zone design, guardrails, standards and tooling.
- **Application Owners**: comply with standards, classify data, provide evidence.
- **CISO/Security**: requirements, assurance, exception decisions.
- **Ops/SRE**: operations, backups, monitoring, incident response.

## 5. Baseline requirements
### 5.1 Landing zone & guardrails
- Separation by **environments** (dev/test/prod) and account/project separation when feasible.
- **Policies** (SCP/Policies) to block critical misconfigurations (e.g., unapproved public storage).
- Approved services catalog (allow-list) and shadow IT management.

### 5.2 Data & encryption
- Data classification (at least: public/internal/confidential).
- Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS) for sensitive data.
- Lifecycle management: retention, deletion, access control.

### 5.3 Logging & monitoring
- Enable audit logs (e.g., CloudTrail/Activity Log) and security logs.
- Centralize into SIEM/dedicated storage; alert on risky events.
- Retention aligned with needs (e.g., 90 days minimum) and regular review.

### 5.4 Workload security
- Hardened images + vulnerability scanning.
- Patch/configuration management.
- Restrict inbound/outbound access (security groups/NSG) and micro-segmentation where feasible.

### 5.5 Third parties & SaaS
- Vendor security assessment (TPRM) prior to onboarding.
- Contractual requirements: incidents, location, subprocessors, exit strategy.

## 6. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Strict prod/non-prod separation (separate accounts), enhanced change control.
- Encryption with **customer-managed keys** (BYOK/HYOK) for critical scopes.
- **Immutable** logging (WORM) + integrity (hash/chain) + time synchronization.
- Continuous monitoring: posture (CSPM), compliance (policy-as-code) and automated remediation.
- Periodic access reviews (monthly for critical scope) and formal recertification.
- Tested cloud incident response plan (table-top + technical exercises) and provider escalation procedures.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exception must be documented, justified, time-bound, compensated (alternative controls) and approved by Security/CISO.

## 8. Expected evidence (examples)
- Landing zone diagrams + environment separation.
- Guardrail/policy extracts.
- Log/alert extracts + proof of centralization.
- Cloud services inventory + owners.
