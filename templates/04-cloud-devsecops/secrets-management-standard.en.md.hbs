# Secrets Management Standard

**Organization:** {{org}}  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** {{today}}

## 1. Purpose
Define requirements for secrets management (passwords, API keys, certificates, tokens, KMS keys, application secrets) to reduce leakage, fraud, and unauthorized access.

## 2. Baseline requirements
### 2.1 Storage
- Secrets must be stored in a **vault** or managed service (e.g., KMS/Secrets Manager/Key Vault).
- Do not store secrets in code, tickets, shared documents, or unprotected variables.

### 2.2 Access
- RBAC and least privilege.
- Separate read/write/admin privileges.

### 2.3 Rotation & lifecycle
- Rotate sensitive secrets regularly (frequency based on criticality).
- Revoke immediately on incidents or offboarding.
- Maintain a secrets inventory and owners.

### 2.4 Distribution
- Inject at runtime using workload identities; avoid static secrets.
- Enable vault access logs.

## 3. Enhanced requirements (regulated sectors)
- Encrypt secrets with dedicated keys; separate environments.
- Strict rotation policy (e.g., < 90 days) for critical scope.
- Secret leak detection (repo/CI scanning) with blocking.
- Two-person rule for critical production secrets.

## 4. Expected evidence (examples)
- Vault configuration + RBAC.
- Rotation/revocation history.
- Secrets inventory (without secret values).
- Secret scan reports.
