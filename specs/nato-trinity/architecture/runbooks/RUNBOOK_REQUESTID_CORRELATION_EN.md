# RUNBOOK — RequestId correlation (EN)

## Goal
Use `requestId` to correlate API errors (problem+json), AuditEvents, and evidence operations.

## Procedure
1) When a client receives an error, capture `requestId` from `application/problem+json`.
2) Query audit events (API or storage) filtering on `requestId`.
3) Identify impacted objectRef (risk/case/evidencePackage) and actor.
4) If needed, export an EvidencePackage for the impacted scope.

## Notes
- `requestId` should be generated by the API gateway and propagated end-to-end (ADR-0013).
- In regulated scope, correlation artifacts should be kept per retention policy.
